		<img id="ProfilePic" src="assets/images/LinkedIn.jpg">
    <p>I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in May 2017 with a bacholers degree in Biological Sciences and will complete Rutgers Coding Bootcamp's Full Stack Flex program in November 2017. </p>
    <br>
    
    <p> As a web developer with a background in Health Sciences, I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. By using the analytical skills that I've developed in the past as a biology student, as well as the coding skills obtained from my professional and educational experiences, I am capable of building fully-functioning applications from the ground up. </p>
    <br>

    <p>I am an aspiring full-stack developer looking to make a mark in the world. I love creating things that help people everyday. I have a vast imagniation and I am constantly finding something new to create. I am driven to excel both independently as well as in teams. </p>
